# Project--R-12

<table>

In this project, We'll use the kyphosis data frame which has 81 rows and 4 columns representing data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery.<br><br/>

It has the following columns:<br>

Kyphosis-a factor with levels absent present indicating if a kyphosis (a type of deformation) was present after the operation.

Age-in months

Number-the number of vertebrae involved

Start-the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.

We will be working on predicting whether the given child is having Kyphosis or not?
